                  for certain data and in regions where local laws require data to be stored within the country. Cloud storage
                  is used for its scalability, accessibility, and resilience, particularly for data that needs to be

                  systems with Encryption and other safeguards to maintain its security even if the storage medium is

                  <strong>Access Controls:</strong> We have implemented Access Controls to restrict access to Privacy Data
                  to authorized personnel only. Access is granted based on the principle of least privilege, meaning that
                  Users are granted the minimum level of access necessary to perform their duties. Access logs are

              <p className="policy-text">
                We are committed to retaining Privacy Data only for as long as it is necessary to fulfil the purposes for
                which it was collected, in compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. We will only
                retain your Privacy Data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including the
                fulfilment of the contract, the initiation of a contract, or for the purposes of satisfying any legal,
                accounting, or other regulatory reporting requirements. Data no longer needed is securely deleted or
                anonymized.
              </p>
              <p className="policy-text">
                Our Data Retention practices are guided by the following principles:
              </p>
              <ul className="policy-list">
                <li>
                  <strong>Purpose-Driven Retention:</strong> Privacy Data is retained only for as long as it serves a
                  legitimate business purpose or is required by law. For instance, employee data may be retained for the
                  duration of employment and for a specified period afterward, as required by labour laws and tax
                  regulations.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Legal Compliance:</strong> We adhere to statutory retention periods as prescribed by laws in the
                  jurisdictions where We operates. For example, in India, certain financial and tax records must be
                  retained for a specific number of years. Similarly, health-related data may be subject to longer retention
                  periods under medical regulations.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Regular Review:</strong> We conduct regular reviews of the Privacy Data We holds to confirm that
                  it is still required for the purposes for which it was collected. Data that is no longer needed is
                  securely deleted, anonymized, or archived in compliance with our Data Retention policies.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Secure Disposal:</strong> When Privacy Data is no longer required, We dispose of securely to
                  prevent unauthorized access or misuse. This may involve securely shredding physical documents, wiping
                  electronic storage devices, or using certified data destruction services for digital records. The Company
                  shall dispose of Privacy Data using a secure destruction mechanism only.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p className="policy-text" style={{ marginTop: '8px' }}>
                Our Data Retention process is designed to balance the need to retain data for business and legal purposes
                with the rights of individuals to have their Privacy Data deleted when it is no longer necessary. To
                determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and
                sensitivity of the Privacy Data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your
                Privacy Data, the purposes for which we process your Privacy Data and whether we can achieve those purposes
                through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

              <p className="policy-text">
                To efficiently manage our global operations and deliver our services, We may need to share Privacy Data
                with third parties. Our approach to data sharing and third-party processing is guided by strict controls and
                oversight:
              </p>
              <ul className="policy-list">
                <li>
                  <strong>Data Sharing with Third Parties:</strong> We may share Privacy Data with selected third-party
                  service providers who assist Us in various aspects of our operations, such as IT services, cloud hosting,
                  marketing, and payroll services. Such third-party vendors may process Privacy Data on the Company’s behalf
                  as necessary, in connection with providing the Company’s products and services, fulfilling contractual
                  arrangements and legal or regulatory requirements. Before engaging any third-party provider, We conduct a
                  due diligence process to assess their data protection practices and verify that they have the ability to
                  meet our stringent requirements. The Company requires that the third-party vendors protect your Privacy
                  Data, only process it for the purposes it was shared for and not disclose it further.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Data Sharing with Group Companies:</strong> In some cases, Privacy Data may be shared with
                  affiliated companies within our corporate group to support joint business activities, such as product
                  development, marketing campaigns, or centralized administrative functions. Data shared within the group
                  is subject to the same level of protection as data handled directly by Granules.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Data Processing Agreements:</strong> Where required, third-party service providers with whom We
                  share Privacy Data are required to enter into Data Processing Agreements (DPAs). These agreements outline
                  the responsibilities of each party, including obligations related to data protection, confidentiality, and
                  security. DPAs also specify the purposes for which the data can be processed and the conditions under
                  which it can be shared with sub-processors. If a confidentiality agreement is in place with a third party,
                  its terms will take precedence over the requirements set out in this Privacy Policy.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Cross-Border Data Transfers:</strong> Given our global operations, Privacy Data may be transferred
                  across borders to jurisdictions where our offices, partners, or service providers are located. We confirm
                  that all Cross-Border Data Transfers comply with applicable data protection laws, including the use of
                  appropriate safeguards such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) or Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs)
                  where required by law.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Data Sharing with Law Enforcement and Government Authorities:</strong> We may share your Privacy
                  Data with law enforcement or government authorities where they have followed due legal process to request
                  the Company to disclose the information.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Monitoring and Compliance:</strong> We actively monitor our third-party service providers to verify
                  ongoing compliance with our data protection standards. This includes regular audits, assessments, and
                  reviews of their data handling practices. In the event of any breach or noncompliance, We take immediate
                  action to address the issue and, if necessary, terminate the relationship with the third party.

                  must do so responsibly, ensuring that no Privacy Data is shared without proper authorization. This

                  for which it was collected, the individual withdraws Consent, or the data has been unlawfully processed.
